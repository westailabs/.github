**AI Infrastructure That Ships in a Box**

We build enterprise-grade AI systems that run on your hardware, under your control.

## What We Do

🏗️ **Moto Workforce** — Mac Mini fleet appliances with role-specific AI agents, self-hosted LLMs, and managed subscriptions. Employees that ship in a box.

🛡️ **Privacy-First AI** — Your data stays on your hardware. No cloud dependency, no data exfiltration, no vendor lock-in.

⚡ **Edge Inference** — Local LLM serving on Apple Silicon and NVIDIA, optimized for real-world latency and cost.

🔧 **MCP & Agentic Workflows** — Model Context Protocol integration, multi-agent orchestration, and composable AI toolchains.
